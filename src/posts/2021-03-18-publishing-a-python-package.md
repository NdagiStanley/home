{{ $frontmatter.title }}
For many software engineers and developers, using standard libraries or built-in objects is just not enough. To save time and increase efficiency, most developers build on work done by others. Whatever the coding problem, there is likely another programmer who has already created a solution for it. There is usually no need to repeat the problem-solving process. This principle is known as Do not Repeat Yourself or DRY.

Code that goes beyond the standard library is often shared between individuals, teams, and even the entire coding community. If you have solved a coding problem, you can make it publicly available as an open source codebase for other developers to benefit from. These collections of code are called packages.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple Python package and create a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for it.

If you are using a popular programming language like JavaScript or Python there will be tools available for publishing your open source packages. For JavaScript, you can use Node Package Manager (NPM). For Python, you can use the Python Package Index, also known as (PyPI). We will be using PyPI for this tutorial.
