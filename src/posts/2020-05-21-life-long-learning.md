## Learning in public

Over and over, I've heard the benefits of learning in public. I have shared my skillset in several ways, a tweet here, a technical or otherwise blog post there.

However, it's not been done whilst in the process of doing it. So this serves as a marker for when mine started.

I'll do my best to adhere to:

- [Barbara Oakley's methods](https://youtu.be/vd2dtkMINIw?t=1980)

    Leverage the two brain modes: [_Focussed_ and _Diffused_](https://youtu.be/vd2dtkMINIw?t=538). Avoiding [procrastination](https://youtu.be/vd2dtkMINIw?t=1140).
- [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/)'s tips based on his book: Atomic Habits summarised well in this [video](https://youtu.be/YT7tQzmGRLA).

### #100DaysOfMath

This is how it started. A challenge by a friend, [Japheth](https://twitter.com/japhethobala):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">100 days of math, anyone?</p>&mdash; Japheth Obala (@japhethobala) <a href="https://twitter.com/japhethobala/status/1263003532954931205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

and by the end of that day (UTC time), I had ticked it off:

Day one down, 99 to go ðŸ’ª.

In true #LearningInPublic fashion partly inspired by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/learn/). I'll continue publishing my journey [here](https://stanmd.tk/learn/math).
