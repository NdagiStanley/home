If this was an article it would be entitled **_Theming Jupyter notebook_**. However, since it falls in the tip category, I'll make it short hence the current title.

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) makes code writing interactive and allows you to publish as you would an article. You can teach with it, learn on it and publish a notebook/s on several platforms like [Github](https://github.com/NdagiStanley/dsa/blob/master/DSA%20-%20Medium.ipynb) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) (examples linked).

A notebook is usually plain white like this:

After going through the installation guide [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) simply run `pip install jupyterthemes` and `jt -t onedork` (in the same virtual environment) before starting the notebook. 

The complete list of commands to run in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install jupyterthemes
jt -t onedork
jupyter notebook
```

Then click on the link in the output starting with the following: `http://localhost:8888/?token=` ...

Before:

After:

![jupyter-dark-mode](../media/screenshot-2019-08-08-14.56.28.png)

To reset simply kill the server, **Ctrl+C** then run `jt -r`. More details are in the [jupyter-themes' github page](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes).
