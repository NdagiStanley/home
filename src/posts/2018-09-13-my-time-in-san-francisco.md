We came, we saw, we conquered.

In June, I had the honour of attending Dockercon in San Francisco. Read my detailed recap of the conference [here](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/dockercon-2018-recap-3e7b75541405).

### Highlights
Here are the highlights for each day of the week I was there:

Sunday:
- Twin Peaks
- Evening Sunday service [at Hillsong San Francisco](https://twitter.com/NdagiStanley/status/1006136745073635329)

Monday:
- House warming for a colleague in Oakland

Tuesday:
- Alcatraz ðŸ™Œ (If you ever watched [Alcatraz, the series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728102/) or [documentaries](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&ei=rNuZW-GvE4y2aYP-tpgP&q=alcatraz+documentary&oq=alcatraz+documentary&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.0.0.0.7812.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.vO0daMsK1Og), this visit is superb)

Friday:
- Fisherman's Wharf

Saturday:
- Bike riding from the Financial District across the Golden Gate bridge to Sausalito. (This was organised by a former primary school classmate who now lives there)

### Misc

I visited a number of offices (at least to their reception):
- Google SF Office
- Mozilla Community Space
- Firefox
- Github
- DropBox
- Octa
- Nebulas

Generally it is a wonderful city. Very expensive to live in (Most expensive city in the US) [The homelessness situation in SF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_San_Francisco_Bay_Area) is no joke.
