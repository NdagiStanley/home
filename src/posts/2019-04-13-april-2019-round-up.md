## Being_Global
"Being global calls for you to be relevant in so many rooms where the rules are different and you have to be flexible enough to function in different types of situations and STILL be true to who you are!

> [![truth](/bible.png)](https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/LUK.12.48) To he whom much is given, much is **expected/required/demanded**.

What got you applauded in one place could get you killed in the next place. Be keen to notice when you step into another arena. You don't want to be in a position where you are confused over THIS 'figuratively' and THAT; so that you go at it as usual.

The more God promotes you, the more ambidextrous you've got to be so that you can serve the vast Body of Christ & Be relevant and effective in the culture too.  #BeingGlobal

## Being_Poor
How to keep at it:
- Self-serving bias (Blaming others)
- You think money is not important. Money is a magnifier
- Buy things you can't afford (Spend less time impressing others, more time impressing yourself)
- You have a scarcity mindset (Have an abundant mindset)
- Not obsessed in your craft

Cure >> Be optimistic:
- Opportunity lies where people complain
- Do you believe it? That's enough. Act on it!
- Any mistake is income! Learn from others mistakes. Look for failure stories!
- Money follows people. People follow dreams

Success/Financial calendar:
- Before 25 - Fail ...
- Before 30 - Follow someone
- 30+ - working for yourself
- 40+ - Focus on things I am good at
- 50+ - Work for young people
- 60+ - Spend time for yourself
