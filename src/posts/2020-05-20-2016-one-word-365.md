  One word versus resolution.

  A word that sums up your vision for your year since one word is easier to
  remember than a page long new year's resolution.

I identify with [\#OneWord365](https://oneword365.com/)'s philosophy. It advocates for choosing one word to for the year Instead of a long new year's resolution.So 2019 🤔what word will I use?

### Guiding principles
I really like **Etymology** (The study of origin of words). So based on this and my growing understanding of (and exposure to) God's word I reason out a number of words and finally settle on one that I most identify with. The word sums up my vision for that year and most certainly contributes to my journey of becoming. We are but most importantly we become; life as nature is mostly fluid, not constant!

## 2016's word

I AM HERE

by God’s appointment,
in His keeping,
under His training,
for His time &
with His incessant company

> 2016: Year of PROGRESS

Forward ever, backward never! ADVANCING

Good thing this path is alive.
